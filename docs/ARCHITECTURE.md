# Architecture

## Layering

calendar-server
- HTTP routing
- OpenAPI: the document at `/api/openapi.json` (rendered by a vendored Swagger UI at `/docs`, no CDN) is 100% generated with utoipa from `#[utoipa::path]` annotations on the handlers; each `*_api.rs` module owns an `#[derive(OpenApi)]` struct merged in `openapi_json()`. Annotating a new route is mandatory — the pinned path inventory in `main.rs`'s test and the interop suite's response validation (`tests/interop/validate_responses.py`) both fail when the document and the handlers disagree

## dav-server-rs integration

Use `dav-server-rs` as the WebDAV/CalDAV protocol foundation where it fits, implementing a PostgreSQL-backed guarded filesystem/resource adapter rather than using LocalFs/MemFs for persistent calendar data.

Do not force the calendar domain into a filesystem-shaped database abstraction where it harms correctness. The adapter should translate DAV operations into domain/repository operations.

## Canonical event model

PostgreSQL normalized records are authoritative.

iCalendar is a protocol representation.

The application must preserve semantics necessary to round-trip supported RFC fields, but must not make arbitrary `.ics` blobs the primary storage format.

## Transaction boundary

Mutations that affect event state, sync journal, audit records and durable jobs must use PostgreSQL transactions.

A successful event mutation must atomically create its change record.

## Change journal

Every sync-visible resource mutation creates a monotonic per-collection/server change sequence.

A sync token identifies a point in that sequence.

Old changes cannot be purged until their retention policy permits it; otherwise a client must receive a signal requiring full resynchronization.

## Resource URLs

Use human-friendly calendar slugs and UUID event resources:

`/calendars/{account}/{calendar-slug}/{event-uuid}.ics`

The exact DAV principal/home-set structure must follow CalDAV discovery conventions.

## Concurrency

Use ETags/If-Match semantics to prevent lost updates.

OpenAPI update operations should expose optimistic concurrency using ETags/version fields.

## Jobs

Durable jobs live in PostgreSQL. Workers run in-process.

Scheduled jobs use `run_at`.
Leased jobs use `locked_until` and worker identity.
Retries use exponential backoff with a maximum.
Self-rescheduling chains (alarm_scan/notify_send, ics_sync, retention_purge) must enqueue through `db::jobs::enqueue_unless_pending` — at most one unfinished job per recurring type is allowed to exist. Unconditional re-enqueue multiplies chains exponentially.

## Security boundaries

Authenticate once at the HTTP layer where possible, but authorization must be checked at the domain/resource boundary so OpenAPI and CalDAV enforce identical permissions.
